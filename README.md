# Quaternions_and_Euler_Angles
IB EE project -> the repository contains files for Unity 2020.3

Hello! This is a Unity project and can be found on a separate branch (master). 
It, the Unity project contains two scenes. In one scene you can (translate and) rotate the object according to Euler angles, and in the other - according to quaternions.
It is possible to encounter a gimbal lock in the first scene if the object would be rotated according to the x axis by 90 (or -90) degrees.
